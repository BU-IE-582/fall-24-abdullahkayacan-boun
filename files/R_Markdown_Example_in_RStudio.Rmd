You can add code chunks and write your R codes in them:

```{r}
x <- 3
x = 2
x
```

```{r}
x=c(1,2,3,4)
print(x)
```

eval=FALSE: do not run code chunk, but it is visible.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
a<-3
a
```

warning=FALSE: warning messages do not appear.

```{r,warning=FALSE}

```

echo=FALSE: do run code chunk, but it is not visible.

```{r,echo=TRUE}

```

You can combine those parameters.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
